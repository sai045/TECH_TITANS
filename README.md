# TECH_TITANS

This a website made for organising a fest named Hi Matsuri. Students have to register themselves and they get credentials which they can use to login themselves later. The login and signup pages are made such that users can also see the type of error they ar making. Students can register themselves to diiferent events. They can also see the events to which they are registered in the dashboard. Every event has it's rule page. But the registration is done at one page only.
